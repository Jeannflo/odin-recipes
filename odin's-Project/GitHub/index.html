    <p>The perfect lasagna recipe made with parmesan ricotta cheese filling, melted mozzarella cheese, lasagna noodles, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is the best lasagna recipe!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <un>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </un>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

    <img id="recipe" src="/odin's-Project/GitHub/Blueberry_Muffin.jpg">
    <p>These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>Muffins:</h2>
    <un>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flou</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries </li>
    </un>
    <h2>Crumb Toppigs:</h2>
    <un>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </un>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with muffin liners.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark. Stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries. Set batter aside.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon for crumb topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
